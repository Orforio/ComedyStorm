ComedyStorm
===========

A simple WoW addon that plays Yakety Sax during the Storm Unleashed phase of the Ta'yak encounter in Heart of Fear.
Yes, it's very silly. It was requested by most of the LFR group I was in on 30/3/2013.

v 0.1
=====
- If user has DBM installed, will only load upon entering Heart of Fear. Will load at startup otherwise.
- Use /comedystorm to toggle between playing and stopping the audio.
- (UNTESTED) Yakety Sax will begin playing once Ta'yak casts Storm Unleashed. Audio will stop when encounter ends (either wipe or boss kill).
